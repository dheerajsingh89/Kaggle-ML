# Recognition of Simpsons Characters
## Here I used the kaggle data set that contains the images of different characters of simpsons which you can see through [Simpsons Character](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset)
## I developed a convolutional neural network model to do classification of images into their respective classes(character) by training the model using the dataset and after that we predict different images
